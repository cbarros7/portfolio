                        <p>
                            According to Abraham Maslow in his theory about human motivations, it’s summarily important
                            to recognize the human being as a living object with different necessities. That’s the
                            reason why we must know how humans interact with our surroundings.</p>
                        <p>
                            Having said that, it’s well known that companies face a lot of challenges when it comes to
                            satisfying their client’s changing necessities. That’s why they are always planning
                            strategies to their benefit and more importantly their clients.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently, many organizations rely on different data-based methods to segment their market
                            by creating subsets based on demographics, needs, priorities, common interests, and other
                            psychographic or behavioral criteria used to understand better their target audience.

                        <p>
                            According to Accenture[1], banks use their data to create process improvements following
                            these aspects:

                            In other words, client classification becomes a competitive improvement because companies
                            can use their time and resources for important things. This is also approved by Bain &
                            Company[3], who says that 81% of businessmen consider client classification as an important
                            way to improve companies profit. Bain also found out that companies with excellent client
                            classifications strategies had an increase of 10% on their profit comparing them with the
                            ones that didn’t during a period of five years.

                            Having said that the main objective of this project was building a customer segmentation
                            based on credit card payments behavior during the last six months to define marketing
                            strategies.

                        <p>
                            Knowing that the dataset had high values on the variable’s standard deviation like it was
                            presented before, we moved on doing some normalization techniques
                            like&nbsp;<strong>StandardScaler,
                                MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler, and Normalizer</strong>, being the last two with better
                            results. Later,
                            we used&nbsp;<strong>Hopkins Statistics</strong>&nbsp;which consists of testing spatial
                            randomness
                            within the data to
                            check for clustering tendencies [4][5]. The values ​​range between 0 and 1. If the result is
                            less than or equal to 0.5 the data is uniformly distributed. On the other hand, if the
                            result is in the range of 0.77–0.99 it represents a high tendency to clustering. For the
                            present case study, the average of the Hopkins statistic resulted in 0.90.

                        <p>
                            Subsequently, the number of clusters (k) optimized with the silhouette value technique was
                            found, which measures how similar a point is to its cluster (cohesion) compared to other
                            clusters (correlation). The Davies Bouldin metric was also taken into account, which is a
                            measure of the average similarity of each cluster with its most similar, where the
                            similarity is the relationship between the distances within the cluster and the distances
                            between the clusters, where the minimum score is zero, and lower values ​​indicate better
                            grouping. So, the result of the above explanation was the optimized (k) number for the
                            present study and it was 5 clusters, as shown in the following image:

                        <p>
                            Now, since the data set has 18 columns it is essential to apply some method of
                            dimensionality reduction. Without a doubt, one of the most widely implemented methods is PCA
                            (Principal Component Analysis), highlighting that this is traditionally a linear technique
                            to project multidimensional data in subspaces of lesser dimension with a minimum loss of
                            variance [6 ]. However, there are several applications where the data is in a
                            lower-dimensional subspace that is not linear, in these cases linear PCA is not the optimal
                            method to retrieve this subspace and therefore represents the largest proportion variance in
                            the data. Therefore, other methods for non-linear data were explored, such
                            as&nbsp;<strong>Isomap</strong>&nbsp;(Isometric Mapping) which seeks a lower-dimensional
                            embedding that
                            maintains the geodetic
                            distances between the points [7], highlighting that the present study was defined with two
                            components. In this way, the data was trained with
                            the&nbsp;<strong>K-Means</strong>&nbsp;algorithm to
                            define each of
                            the clusters, resulting in the grouping that can be seen below:

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Finally, based on the clustering carried out by the algorithm of each client, the Random
                            Forest classifier was applied to determine the most relevant features (columns) for the
                            classification, to reduce data dimensionality for a detailed analysis. The threshold was
                            defined as 0.06, resulting in the most relevant columns being: BALANCE, PURCHASES,
                            CASH_ADVANCE, CREDIT_LIMIT, PAYMENTS, MINIMUM_PAYMENTS with a precision in the classifier of
                            96%.

                            From the most essential features, an analysis was made to establish customer's behaviors and
                            the difference between them.

                            From the frequency of the cluster of observation, it can be seen that most of the customers
                            are classified in the third and fourth clusters. From this observation, a detailed analysis
                            was made regarding the behavior of the classification concerning the most important

                            it can be seen that the clusters classified as 0, 2, and 4 represent few payments in
                            advance, as opposed to clusters 1 and 3.

                            others classified in clusters 0, 1, 3, and 4. If a relationship is made between “PURCHASES”
                            and “CASH_ADVANCE” It can be concluded that clients classified in cluster 2 have high
                            purchases but their cash payment in advance is low, unlike clients classified in clusters 1
                            and 3 with a high number of cash advances but low purchases.

                            average of 588 USD being the lowest. If we analyze the PURCHASES variable, it can be seen
                            that clients classified in the 2nd cluster are the ones that have the most PURCHASES with an
                            average of 4,080 USD, unlike the clients classified on other clusters.

                            makes sense if we take into account that as purchases increase, the customer’s balance

                            of 588 USD, being the lowest. If we analyze the PAYMENTS variable, it can be seen that
                            clients classified in the second cluster are the ones that reach an average value of 4,294
                            USD followed by the third one with an average of 3,445 USD.

                                    is proportional to the movement of their purchases, this means that they are good
                                    customers paying the debts they incur with their credit cards.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Cluster 1:</strong>&nbsp;In this group are presented the customers who pay
                                    the most in advance before the loan starts with a balanced balance statement because
                                    their purchases are minimal compared to the other groups, also it is the second-best
                                    paying.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Cluster 2:</strong>&nbsp;Customers in this cluster pay the minimum amount in
                                    advance, however, it is the group that buys the most, and it is also the group that
                                    pays the most. In other words, these types of customers are quite active regarding
                                    the number of purchases they make with their credit cards.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Cluster 3:</strong>&nbsp;These clients are the ones with the highest balance
                                    status, in addition to that, they are the second group that pays the most in advance
                                    before starting their credit. However, they are the customers who make the least
                                    purchases and following the same idea, they are the seconds when it comes to making
                                    payments on the debt with their credit card. This makes sense since they have an
                                    amount of the loan provided in advance. It can be concluded that they are
                                    conservative and meticulous customers when buying.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Cluster 4:</strong>&nbsp;This group of customers has low-frequency usage of
                                    their credit cards since it is the second group that purchases the least, in
                                    addition to that, they are customers who pay well in proportion to their purchases.
                                    As for the advance payment before starting the loan, it is minimal compared to the
                                    other groups.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Finally, marketing strategies can be applied based on these conclusions depending on the
                            company’s goals, for example, if the company wants to carry out a marketing campaign to
                            encourage the use of credit cards and at the same time apply them to customers with good
                            payment behavior, groups 1 and 2 are ideal to take a look at. On the other hand, customers
                            in group 3 are the most conservative when it comes to buying, therefore marketing strategies
                            for this group should be different.

                        <p>
                            For future studies, both numerical and categorical variables must be taken into account to
                            carry out a more in-depth analysis relating to the types of variables mentioned above. On
                            the other hand, it is recommended to explore different preprocessors and normalizers
                            available in the scikit-learn package [8].
