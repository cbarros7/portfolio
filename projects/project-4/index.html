                        <p>
                            The main challenges currently facing the energy sector according to Deloitte [1] are related
                            to three aspects: 1) generation, 2) distribution, and 3) consumption. The role of
                            technology in these challenges plays a crucial role, as the digital transformation of
                            utilities
                            can improve the efficiency of power generation and electricity transmission and
                            distribution while
                            providing consumers with more capacity and choice in their energy use. In the same vein,
                            General Electric
                            states that the digitalization of energy consumption is critical along with demand
                            management [2], for
                            example, demand response programs are increasingly managed through digital solutions that
                            help manage
                            customer demand response and facilitate associated financial exchanges between utilities and
                            their
                            customers.</p>
                        <p>
                            The main objective of this study is to forecast the energy consumption of 369 customers
                            based on
                            historical data from January to April 2014 using 3 algorithms with the AWS cloud service.

                            The average energy consumption in January was 526 kWh (<strong>see graph 1</strong>), with a
                            decrease in February
                            and March; however, in April it showed an upward trend, reaching an average of 552 kWh, this
                            being
                            the month when most energy was consumed.

                            The average energy consumption per day has a similar trend in the months, for the month of
                            January
                            (<strong>see graph 2</strong>) the peak was located on day 3 with 556 kWh and the lowest
                            consumption
                            was on day 19 with 456 kWh.

                            In February (<strong>see Appendix 1</strong>), the day of highest consumption was the 4th
                            with 546 kWh and 436 kWh,
                            and the day of the lowest consumption was the 16th. However, in March (<strong>see appendix
                                2</strong>) the highest
                            consumption was on the 15th with 536 kWh and at the end of the month, on the 30th, it showed
                            the lowest
                            consumption with 496 kWh. Finally, April (<strong>see Appendix 3</strong>) had its highest
                            consumption on the 17th with
                            600 kWh, and three days later, that is, on April 20th it presented its lowest consumption
                            with 501 kWh.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, concerning the consumption of the days of the week, the months analyzed have
                            maintained a similar trend
                            in the increase in energy consumption from Thursday to Sunday (<strong>see graph
                                3</strong>).

                            <strong>Graph 4</strong> shows the behavior of energy consumption per hour. It should be
                            noted that the same trend was maintained
                            throughout the months, i.e. between 19:00 and 21:00, the highest consumption was recorded,
                            with an average of 685 kWh.
                            On the other hand, at 5:00 a.m. every month the lowest energy consumption is recorded, with
                            an average of 300 kWh.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the meantime, because the number of customers is large, for exploratory
                            analysis, the customers who consume
                            the most energy over the months will be taken into account on the condition that their
                            consumption is equal to or greater
                            than 5,000 kWh.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In <strong>graph 5</strong>, it can be seen that the customer with the id 361 presented
                            greater energy consumption during the months analyzed,
                            with April 13 being the day that generated a peak in its trend with 43,306 kWh. It is
                            important to mention that the drop observed
                            at the end of the graph is since on April 29th only 2 hours are recorded,
                            because the data set ends on that day at
                            02:00, therefore, the forecast will be made for the following 36 hours.
                        </p>

                            A stationary trend can be observed in the consumption behavior of these customers in the
                            first 15 days (<strong>see graph 6</strong>)
                            throughout all the months. For example, the customer with id 361 has the highest consumption
                            between 22:00
                            and 02:00, the customer with id 195 has the highest consumption between 17:00 and 18:00.

                            On the other hand, the client with id 278 its hourly trend is located in the range of 19:00
                            and 21:00. Finally, the
                            client with the id 396 presents variations in his behavior with a schedule between 09:00 and
                            12:00, and the evening
                            between 20:00 and 23:00. Also, these customers generally consume the most energy at
                            the weekend.

                        <p>
                            The forecast result of the algorithm that best fitted the 50 and 90 quantiles was DeepAR+
                            (<strong>see figure 8</strong>) concerning the other two algorithms
                            (<strong>see appendix 4 and 5</strong>). Also, it was
                            the one that was closest to the average for a week before the forecast, that
                            is, the days
                            between 21/04/2014 and 29/04/2014 (<strong>figure 9</strong>).

                            It can be observed that the behavior of energy consumption a week before the forecast
                            maintains a
                            stationary trend presenting a higher consumption in the hours between 17:00 and 21:00. The
                            above
                            is consistent with the forecast since the peak in average energy consumption is at 18:00 on
                            29/04/2014
                            with 792 kWh in the 90th quarter. After this time the consumption decreases until 04:00 on
                            30/04/2014
                            with 359 kWh, thus starting the consumption increase from 05:00.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, with respect to the main customers specified in the exploratory analysis section,
                            it can be
                            concluded that for the customer with id 361 the peak of highest consumption on 04/29/2014
                            was at 21:00
                            with 64,582 kWh(<strong>see graph 10</strong>), however, this figure is exceeded the
                            following day(04/30/2014) at 13:00
                            with 67,904 kWh which could indicate an increase in consumption for the last day of April.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:center;"><img

                        <p>
                            As can be seen, the behaviour of the other customers is similar, for example, for the
                            customer with id 195 its highest
                            consumption forecast for 29/04/2014 was at 18:00 with 27,376 kWh, however, this figure is
                            exceeded on 30/04/2014
                            at 12:00 with 28,193 kWh. Customers with id 278 and 369 showed a linear trend in energy
                            consumption.
                        </p>

                        <p style="font-size:35px"> <strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            In accordance with the hypotheses put forward in this study, it could be determined that the
                            general average
                            of the months analysed remains in a similar range (520 kWh - 550 kWh). Similarly, a similar
                            trend was
                            observed in the behaviour of energy consumption in the range of hours, days of the week and
                            month. On
                            the other hand, the average energy consumption of the last 7 days prior to the forecast is
                            in line with
                            the results obtained in the forecast. Finally, it is considered that the day 30/04/2014 will
                            have a higher
                            consumption than the previous day, this statement can also be reflected with the main
                            customers mentioned
                            in the exploratory analysis section.

                        <p>
                            For further studies, it is recommended to take into account a wider range of hours/days in
                            the forecast while
                            retaining the methodology of using several algorithms in order to find the one that best
                            fits the data set
                            with the 50 and 90 quantatiles respectively.
